`Spring Boot POS System`
A simple and efficient Point-of-Sale (POS) system built with Spring Boot, using PostgreSQL as the database. This application provides APIs to manage products, orders, customers, and other essential POS operations.

Features
CRUD Operations: Manage products, categories, and customers.
Global Response Wrapper: All API responses include a standardized format with status code, message, and data.
Exception Handling: Centralized error handling for consistent error messages.
Database Integration: Uses PostgreSQL as the database with JPA/Hibernate for ORM.
Transaction Management: Ensures data integrity during complex operations.
Environment-Based Configuration: Supports configuration through .env for environment variables.
Interceptors: Add middleware logic like logging or request transformation.
Prerequisites
Java 17+: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Maven: For building and managing dependencies.
PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL and create a database for the application.
Environment Variables:
Use a .env file or system environment variables for database and application configuration.
Environment Configuration
The application reads environment variables from the .env file or the system environment.

Example .env File:
env
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=pos_system
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

# Application properties
SERVER_PORT=8080
Mapping Environment Variables in application.properties:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

server.port=${SERVER_PORT}
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-pos.git
cd spring-boot-pos
2. Build the Application
Run the following command to build the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
3. Run the Application
Use the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start on the port specified in the .env file or default to 8080.

Key Components
1. Global API Response Wrapper
All responses from the API are wrapped in the following structure:

json
Copy code
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Request successful",
  "data": { /* actual response data */ }
}
code: The HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 400, 500).
status: Indicates if the request was successful (success) or not (error).
message: Descriptive message about the request result.
data: Contains the actual response payload.
2. Exception Handling
All exceptions are handled globally using @ControllerAdvice. Errors are returned in the following format:

json
Copy code
{
  "code": 500,
  "status": "error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred!",
  "data": null
}
3. Transaction Management
Annotations like @Transactional ensure that operations involving multiple database actions are handled atomically.

Database Setup
Install PostgreSQL and create a database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE pos_system;
CREATE USER your_db_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_db_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE pos_system TO your_db_user;
Ensure your .env file contains the correct database credentials.
